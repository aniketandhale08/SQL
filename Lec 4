Primary key
Unique Key
Auto Increment

*CRUD
create - Insert
read - select
update - update
delete- delete

- Lets create one table and add some values in it, so we can do further operation on that

CREATE TABLE employee ( id int PRIMARY KEY, firstname varchar(20) NOT NULL, middlename varchar(20), lastname varchar(20) NOT NULL, 
                        age int NOT NULL, salary int NOT NULL, location varchar(20) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'Pune' );

INSERT INTO employee(id, firstname, lastname, age, salary) VALUES (1, 'anu', 'andhale', 28, 10000);
INSERT INTO employee (id, firstname, lastname, age, salary) VALUES (2, 'rushi', 'andhale', 30, 20000);
INSERT INTO employee(id, firstname, lastname, age, salary) VALUES (3, 'gaju', 'andhale', 32, 30000);


*SELECT
- remember the * means give me all colums

*to get particular colums ro selecting specific colum
select firstname, lastname  from employee;

*select by applying a where clause (filter condition)
select * from employee where age > 29;
select * from employee where firstname='gaju';

- SQL is by default case insensitive.
select * from employee where firstname='Gaju';
from this above query i can get teh record but in our record have you observe that gaju's first letter is small letter but in query 
we written in capital, then also we got our result. but wait, when we want exacltly same record with case sensitivity, then what to do?

we can write below query with adding "binary" keyword in it, which will take care of case sensitivity.
select * from employee where binary firstname='Gaju';

*Alias
select firstname as name, lastname as surname from employee;
- this will show already created column in demanded columnname.


*UPDATE
- this will change or modify the record

- if i want to change one of the surname of record by using the update.
update employee set lastname='mundhe' where firstname='anu';
update employee set location='Mumbai' where firstname='rushi';
select * from employee;

update employee set location='Pune';
-this will change entire column location as 'Pune'

update employee set location ='Nashik' where firstname='anu' and lastname='mundhe';
