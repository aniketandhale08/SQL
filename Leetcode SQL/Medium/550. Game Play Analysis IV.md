## Table: Activity

| Column Name  | Type |
|--------------|------|
| player_id    | int  |
| device_id    | int  |
| event_date   | date |
| games_played | int  |

(player_id, event_date) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.  
This table shows the activity of players of some games.  
Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on someday using some device.

## Problem

Write a solution to report the fraction of players that logged in again on the day after the day they first logged in.

In other words:
- Find each player’s first login date.
- Check whether the player logged in again on the next day.
- Count such players.
- Divide by total number of players.
- Round the result to 2 decimal places.

## Example 1

### Input:

Activity table:

| player_id | device_id | event_date | games_played |
|------------|-----------|------------|--------------|
| 1          | 2         | 2016-03-01 | 5            |
| 1          | 2         | 2016-03-02 | 6            |
| 2          | 3         | 2017-06-25 | 1            |
| 3          | 1         | 2016-03-02 | 0            |
| 3          | 4         | 2018-07-03 | 5            |

### Output:

| fraction |
|----------|
| 0.33     |

Explanation:  
Only player 1 logged in the day after their first login.  
Total players = 3 → 1/3 = 0.33

## Answer

```sql
select round(
    count(distinct a.player_id) / 
    (select count(distinct player_id) from Activity),
    2
) as fraction
from Activity a
join (
    select player_id, min(event_date) as first_login
    from Activity
    group by player_id
) b
on a.player_id = b.player_id
and a.event_date = date_add(b.first_login, interval 1 day);
