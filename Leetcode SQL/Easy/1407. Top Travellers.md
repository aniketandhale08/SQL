## Problem Statement

Write a solution to report the **distance traveled by each user**.

Return the result table ordered by:
1. `travelled_distance` in **descending order**
2. `name` in **ascending order** if two or more users traveled the same distance.

The result format is shown in the following example.

## Example 1

### Input

**Users table:**

| id | name     |
|----|----------|
| 1  | Alice    |
| 2  | Bob      |
| 3  | Alex     |
| 4  | Donald   |
| 7  | Lee      |
| 13 | Jonathan |
| 19 | Elvis    |

**Rides table:**

| id | user_id | distance |
|----|---------|----------|
| 1  | 1       | 120      |
| 2  | 2       | 317      |
| 3  | 3       | 222      |
| 4  | 7       | 100      |
| 5  | 13      | 312      |
| 6  | 19      | 50       |
| 7  | 7       | 120      |
| 8  | 19      | 400      |
| 9  | 7       | 230      |

### Output

| name     | travelled_distance |
|----------|--------------------|
| Elvis    | 450                |
| Lee      | 450                |
| Bob      | 317                |
| Jonathan | 312                |
| Alex     | 222                |
| Alice    | 120                |
| Donald   | 0                  |

---

### Explanation

- Elvis and Lee traveled `450` miles; Elvis comes first because his name is alphabetically smaller.
- Bob, Jonathan, Alex, and Alice have one or more rides.
- Donald did not have any rides, so his traveled distance is `0`.

## Answer

```sql
select u.name, ifnull(sum(r.distance), 0) as travelled_distance
from Users u
left join Rides r
on u.id = r.user_id
group by u.id, u.name
order by travelled_distance desc, u.name asc;
