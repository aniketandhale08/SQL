## Example 1

### Input

**Visits table:**

| visit_id | customer_id |
|----------|-------------|
| 1        | 23          |
| 2        | 9           |

| 7        | 54          |
| 8        | 54          |

**Transactions table:**

| transaction_id | visit_id | amount |
|----------------|----------|--------|
| 2              | 5        | 310    |
| 3              | 5        | 300    |
| 9              | 5        | 200    |

| 13             | 2        | 970    |

---

### Output

| customer_id | count_no_trans |
|-------------|----------------|
| 54          | 2              |
| 30          | 1              |
| 96          | 1              |

---

### Explanation

- Customer `30` visited once and made no transactions.
- Customer `96` visited once and made no transactions.
- Customer `54` visited three times; during **two visits** no transactions were made.
- Customers `23` and `9` are excluded because they made transactions during their visits.

## Answer

```sql
select v.customer_id, count(*) as count_no_trans
from Visits v
left join Transactions t
on v.visit_id = t.visit_id
where t.visit_id is null
group by v.customer_id;

-- OR

select customer_id, count(customer_id) as count_no_trans 
from Visits
where visit_id not in (select visit_id from Transactions)
group by customer_id;
